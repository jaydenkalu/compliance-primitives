//! `jurisdiction-flag` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that attaches a
//! jurisdiction code (e.g. an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code) to an
//! address.
//!
//! **Permission semantics**: `is_permitted_jurisdiction` uses *any*
//! matching — it returns `true` if at least one of the address's codes
//! appears in `allowed_codes`. An address with no codes is never permitted.
//!
//! **Code format**: `set_jurisdiction` only accepts ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes
//! written as exactly two *uppercase* ASCII letters (`"US"`, `"GB"`, …).
//! Anything else — empty, too short/long, lowercase (`"us"`), or containing
//! non-letters (`"U1"`, `"U-"`) — is rejected with
//! `Error::InvalidJurisdictionCode`. Codes are never normalized: matching in
//! `is_permitted_jurisdiction` stays exact and case-sensitive (#54), so
//! requiring the canonical uppercase form on write guarantees an address
//! can't be flagged as `"us"` and then silently fail to match an
//! `allowed_codes` entry of `"US"`.
//!
//! **Callers**: the configured issuer or compliance officer may call
//! `set_jurisdiction` and `add_jurisdiction`; only the issuer may call
//! `remove_jurisdiction`, `remove_jurisdiction_multiple`, or `upgrade`.
//! `set_jurisdiction` / `get_jurisdiction` remain single-code conveniences.
//! Use `add_jurisdiction`, `remove_jurisdiction`, and `list_jurisdictions`
//! for the multi-code model. Any contract or off-chain client can read codes
//! and call `is_permitted_jurisdiction(address, allowed_codes)` directly.
