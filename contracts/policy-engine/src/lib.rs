//! `policy-engine` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that composes multiple
//! compliance checks into a single policy evaluation call.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Each compliance primitive in this workspace answers one narrow question
//! about an address ("is it denylisted?", "is it in a permitted
//! jurisdiction?", "is it allowlisted?"). Real issuance policies are rarely
//! that narrow: they combine several of those answers with AND / OR logic
//! and must be changeable as regulation evolves. `policy-engine` holds that
//! composition on-chain, so a token contract makes **one** call —
//! `evaluate(from, to)` — and gets back a single pass/fail decision for the
//! whole policy, instead of hard-coding a sequence of cross-contract calls
//! that would need a redeploy every time the policy changes.
//!
//! ## Who calls it
//!
//! - **Token / transfer contracts** (the primary callers) invoke
//!   `evaluate(from, to)` or `batch_evaluate(pairs)` before moving value and
//!   refuse the transfer when the result is `false`. These calls are
//!   permissionless and require no auth.
//! - **The policy admin** (an issuer key or, preferably, a `multisig-admin`
//!   contract address) calls `initialize`, `add_check`, `remove_check` and
//!   `set_circuit_breaker` to manage the policy. Every mutation requires the
//!   stored admin's auth.
//! - **Off-chain tooling and auditors** call the read-only views
//!   (`get_checks`, `get_op`, `get_policy`, `circuit_breaker`) and consume
//!   the `PolicyResult` event stream to reconstruct every decision.
//!
//! ## How it composes with the other contracts
//!
//! | Contract | Relationship to `policy-engine` |
//! |---|---|
//! | `denylist-gate` | Registered as a [`CheckKind::Denylist`] check; `evaluate` calls its `check(address)`. |
//! | `jurisdiction-flag` | Registered as a [`CheckKind::Jurisdiction`] check; `evaluate` calls `is_permitted_jurisdiction(address, allowed_codes)`. |
//! | `allowlist-token` | Registered as a [`CheckKind::Allowlist`] check; `evaluate` calls its `is_allowed(address)`. |
//! | `circuit-breaker` | Optional emergency stop. When configured and frozen, `evaluate` denies outright without running any check. |
//! | `multisig-admin` | Recommended value for the `admin` address, so policy changes require M-of-N approval via `__check_auth`. |
//! | `pausable` | Shared crate used to guard admin mutations (`add_check`, `remove_check`) while the contract is paused. |
//! | `audit-log` | Complementary: integrators that need an on-chain, contract-readable trail of policy changes record them there; `policy-engine` itself only emits events. |
//! | `compliance-aggregator` | Sibling, not a dependency. The aggregator is a fixed AND-only fan-out optimised for call overhead; `policy-engine` is the configurable AND / OR layer. Pick one per integration. |
//!
//! The primitives are called through locally declared `#[contractclient]`
//! interfaces rather than direct crate dependencies, so any contract that
//! exposes the same function signature can be plugged in as a check.
//!
//! ## AND / OR design choice
//!
//! Compliance use cases almost always reduce to one of two logical shapes:
//! every check must pass (AND — "this address must be allowlisted **and** in
//! a permitted jurisdiction") or at least one must pass (OR — "this address
//! either cleared KYC with provider A **or** provider B"). A two-variant
//! `CombineOp` enum (`All` / `Any`) covers both without the overhead of an
//! AST, which would be over-engineered for this domain and would add
//! significant complexity to the storage, serialization, and auditing story.
//!
//! ## Check failure surfacing
//!
//! `evaluate` returns `Ok(bool)` rather than panicking or returning an
//! opaque error on a failed policy: a Soroban invocation that returns a
//! contract error rolls back all state changes including emitted events, so
//! any failure audit trail would be silently discarded. By returning
//! `Ok(false)` and emitting a `PolicyResult` event the caller gets a
//! machine-readable result and the chain preserves an auditable record of
//! the decision, consistent with the pattern used in `allowlist-token`.
//!
//! ## Registration design
//!
//! Checks are stored as an admin-managed, mutable `Vec<CheckKind>` in
//! persistent storage. This lets the issuer add, reorder, or remove checks
//! as compliance requirements evolve — without redeploying or upgrading the
//! contract binary. An authorized admin is required for all mutations,
//! keeping the policy immutable to unprivileged callers.
//!
//! ## Upgradeability
//!
//! `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` lets the configured admin move the
//! contract's code to a new WASM hash via
//! `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm`, following the same
//! admin-gated pattern used elsewhere in the repo (see `jurisdiction-flag`).
//! Storage (the admin key, `CombineOp`, and the registered `Checks` vec) is
//! untouched by the WASM swap, so all state is preserved and the contract
//! remains fully callable immediately after the upgrade. Only the admin can
//! call `upgrade`; any other caller is rejected with `Error::NotAuthorized`.
//!
//! ## Storage and TTL policy
//!
//! All state (admin, `CombineOp`, the `Checks` vec and the optional
//! circuit-breaker address) lives in **instance** storage, which shares a
//! single TTL with the contract instance itself. Every write path
//! (`initialize`, `set_circuit_breaker`, `add_check`, `remove_check`)
//! finishes by extending that TTL: whenever the remaining TTL has dropped
//! below [`INSTANCE_TTL_THRESHOLD`] (~7 days) it is bumped back up to
//! [`INSTANCE_TTL_EXTEND_TO`] (~90 days). This keeps the policy from being
//! archived by Soroban state expiration — an archived policy would make
//! `evaluate` unreachable until a manual restore.

/// ## Intended use
///
/// `CheckFailure` is the payload surfaced by [`PolicyEngine::evaluate_verbose`],
/// an extended variant of `evaluate` that returns the index and kind of the
/// **first** check that caused the policy to fail, in addition to the overall
/// pass/fail result. This makes it possible to diagnose a failed policy
/// evaluation without re-running each check individually in a separate call.
///
/// ### Design sketch
///
/// ```text
/// evaluate_verbose(env, from, to)
///   -> Result<(bool, Option<CheckFailure>), Error>
/// ```
///
/// - When the policy **passes**, the second element is `None`.
/// - When the policy **fails**, the second element is `Some(CheckFailure)`
///   where `check_index` is the zero-based position of the first failing check
///   in the registered `Vec<CheckKind>` and `kind` is a `Symbol` naming the
///   variant (e.g. `Symbol::new(env, "Denylist")`).
///
/// Off-chain tooling (block explorers, compliance dashboards) can call
/// `evaluate_verbose` once and immediately know both the outcome and, on
/// failure, precisely which rule triggered the rejection — without needing to
/// reconstruct the full check list from storage.
///
/// ### Why `Option<CheckFailure>` instead of embedding in the error
///
/// `evaluate` deliberately returns `Ok(false)` on a policy failure rather than
/// `Err(...)` so that the emitted `PolicyResult` event is not rolled back (see
/// the module-level doc comment for the full rationale). `evaluate_verbose`
/// preserves this invariant: the `CheckFailure` detail rides in the `Ok(…)`
/// payload alongside the bool, keeping events auditable while surfacing richer
/// diagnostic data to callers.
///
/// ### Tracking
///
/// `evaluate_verbose` is implemented in this contract. See the
/// `evaluate_verbose` function below. Future work could extend `CheckFailure`
/// with additional fields (e.g. the address that failed, or the full
/// `CheckKind` payload) if callers need more context.
