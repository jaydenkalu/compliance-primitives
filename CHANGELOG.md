## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **compliance-aggregator**: Admin-gated `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`
  entrypoint with an `UpgradePerformed` event, a migration test that
  deploys, writes state, upgrades, and verifies state is intact and callable,
  and module-level upgrade documentation (#195)
- **compliance-aggregator**: `check_address` budget-regression benchmark
  with a `[compliance-aggregator.check_address]` entry in
  `budget-baselines.toml` (#196)
- **multisig-admin**: Expanded module-level docs covering purpose, callers,
  and composition with the other contracts in the repo (#197)
- **multisig-admin**: Instance TTL is extended on every write path
  (`INSTANCE_TTL_THRESHOLD` / `INSTANCE_TTL_EXTEND_TO`), with tests that
  advance the ledger past the original TTL (#198)
- **multisig-admin**: `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` entrypoint, gated by the M-of-N
  threshold, with a migration test confirming state survives the upgrade
- **multisig-admin**: `__check_auth` resource-fee benchmark and
  `[multisig-admin.__check_auth]` baseline in `budget-baselines.toml`
- **policy-engine**: Instance-storage TTL extension on every write path
  (threshold ~7 days, extend-to ~90 days)

### Changed

- **policy-engine**: Expanded module-level docs covering purpose, callers,
  composition with the other contracts, and the TTL policy
